1. Our encoding of line information is hilariously wasteful of memory. Given that a series of instructions often correspond to the same source line, a natural solution is something akin to run-length encoding of the line numbers.
2. Because OP_CONSTANT uses only a single byte for its operand, a chunk may only contain up to 256 different constants. That’s small enough that people writing real-world code will hit that limit. We could use two or more bytes to store the operand, but that makes every constant instruction take up more space. Most chunks won’t need that many unique constants, so that wastes space and sacrifices some locality in the common case to support the rare case.
3. Our reallocate() function relies on the C standard library for dynamic memory allocation and freeing. malloc() and free() aren’t magic. Find a couple of open source implementations of them and explain how they work. How do they keep track of which bytes are allocated and which are free? What is required to allocate a block of memory? Free it? How do they make that efficient? What do they do about fragmentation?
